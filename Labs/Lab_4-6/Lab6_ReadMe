##Objective  
Build and evaluate a **logistic regression model** in **BigQuery ML** to predict customer churn based on demographic, subscription, and behavioral features.  
This lab demonstrates how to integrate SQL-based machine learning within BigQuery for efficient model development, training, and evaluation.

---

##Learning Outcomes  
- Understand how **BigQuery ML** enables machine learning directly in SQL.  
- Create and train a **logistic regression model** to classify churn outcomes.  
- Evaluate performance using key metrics — **accuracy**, **log_loss**, and **ROC AUC**.  
- Interpret model results to understand how feature quality affects predictions.

##Workflow Overview  

| Step | Description | Output |
|------|--------------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | Prepared churn dataset with demographic and engagement features | `churn_features` table |
| 2️⃣ | Created logistic regression model | `churn_model` |
| 3️⃣ | Evaluated model performance using `ML.EVALUATE` | Accuracy, log_loss, ROC AUC |
| 4️⃣ | Generated predictions via `ML.PREDICT` | Probability-based churn scores |
| 5️⃣ | Interpreted metrics and reflected on model improvements | Enhanced understanding of logistic regression |

##Key Metrics  
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Accuracy | ~0.85 | Model correctly predicted 85% of churn outcomes |
| Log Loss | ~0.42 | Indicates moderate calibration and probability confidence |
| ROC AUC | ~0.51 | Suggests limited separation; further feature engineering needed |

##Short Reflection Overview  
This lab demonstrated how to efficiently build a logistic regression model using **BigQuery ML** without leaving the SQL environment.  
Through dataset preparation, training, evaluation, and prediction, I gained practical insight into how **feature quality and class balance** directly affect model performance and generalization.  
The workflow also reinforced the importance of **interpreting metrics holistically** rather than focusing on a single score.

##DIVE Mindset Reflection  

**Describe:**  
I built a logistic regression model using BigQuery ML to predict customer churn, performing model creation, evaluation, and prediction entirely through SQL queries.

**Interpret:**  
Each query clarified how feature engineering, missingness, and categorical encoding influence model accuracy and stability.

**Validate:**  
By analyzing accuracy, log_loss, and ROC AUC, I validated the model’s predictive behavior — realizing it performed reasonably but lacked depth for complex churn patterns.

**Explore:**  
Next, I plan to experiment with **boosted trees** and **neural network models** in BigQuery ML and enhance interpretability through **feature importance analysis** and **data enrichment**.
